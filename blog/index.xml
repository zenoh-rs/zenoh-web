&lt;p>This year marks a very important landmark for us. After having kicked-off the &lt;a href="http://edgenative.eclipse.org">Eclipse Edge Native&lt;/a> working group, last December, we are bringing &lt;a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-zenoh">zenoh&lt;/a> to Eclipse and are starting to work a &lt;a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust&lt;/a> rewrite of the &lt;strong>zenoh&lt;/strong> router.
As part for the rewrite we have just about to complete a review of the &lt;strong>zenoh&lt;/strong> protocol and will be updating the specification accordingly in the weeks to come.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zenoh Tidings</title><link>/blog/2020-06-29-zenoh-tidings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020-06-29-zenoh-tidings/</guid><description>&lt;p>In our last blog we had announced a rewrite of &lt;a href="http://zenoh.io">&lt;strong>zenoh&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> in &lt;a href="http://rust-lang.org">Rust&lt;/a>. The wrote the first version of zenoh in &lt;a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml&lt;/a>, a super-neat ML-derived functional programming language. &lt;a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml&lt;/a> allowed us to experiment very quickly and have good performances. Yet, one of the major feedback we were receiving from the community was that few people knew this programming language and this was limiting contributions. Beside, we had the desire to make zenoh even faster and smaller. One obvious choice would have been to write the new version in C/C++, yet something we did not want to loose were the safety properties we enjoyed with &lt;a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml&lt;/a>. Additionally, if we had to leave our beloved &lt;a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml&lt;/a>, we did not want to completely give away high level abstractions. We also wanted to avoid languages that had a heavy runtime and a garbage collector. We had already looked at &lt;a href="http://rust-lang.org">Rust&lt;/a> back in 2015, but at the point we did not feel it was the right choice for us. The improvements introduced in the programming language with the 2018 edition along with the introduction at a language level &lt;strong>async&lt;/strong> make &lt;a href="http://rust-lang.org">Rust&lt;/a> a perfect choice for zenoh.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zenoh Aithusa Hatched Out!</title><link>/blog/2020-10-08-aithusa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020-10-08-aithusa/</guid><description>&lt;p>We have been waiting this very moment for several months.

received an increasing attention in the community. The discovery overhead
issue becomes extremely severe when running over wireless technologies,
such as WiFi, and in particular in combination with more complex robots, robot
swarms and tele-operation. The &lt;a href="https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Discovery-Server/Discovery-Server.html">ROS2 Discovery Service&lt;/a> has been proposed
as a way to alleviate the problem, not necessarily to solve it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the reminder of this post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain the essence of problem,
remind what was tried in the past and unveils a &lt;a href="https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh">&lt;strong>Zenoh&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> based solution that
(1) drastically reduces DDS discovery overhead &amp;ndash; from 97% to 99,9% in tested scenarios,
(2) allows for peer-to-peer communication when useful,
(3) enables efficient Internet-scale routing when necessary, and
(3) does not require any changes to your existing ROS2 systems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Integrating ROS2 with Eclipse zenoh</title><link>/blog/2021-04-28-ros2-integration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021-04-28-ros2-integration/</guid><description>&lt;p>In our &lt;a href="./2021-03-23-discovery/">previous blog&lt;/a> we demonstrated how the &lt;a href="https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-plugin-dds">zenoh bridge for DDS&lt;/a> allows to (1) bridge DDS communications through zenoh, and (2) reduce by up to 99.97% the discovery traffic between the nodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The previous blog was focusing on demonstrating the advantages of using zenoh as the mean for ROS2-to-ROS2 communication over wireless technologies. In this blog, we’ll go one step further and will demonstrate how you can easily write native zenoh applications —meaning that has no dependencies on ROS2 — and seamlessly interact with &lt;a href="https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html">ROS2&lt;/a> applications. Finally, we will show how you can extend your communication to Internet scale, allowing to cover all the typical cases for Robot-to-anything (R2X) communication.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zenoh Reliability, Scalability and Congestion Control</title><link>/blog/2021-06-14-zenoh-reliability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021-06-14-zenoh-reliability/</guid><description>&lt;p>Providing many to many reliable communications over a wide area network is challenging. This may even be an understatement, as theoretically, even simple point to point reliable communication over asynchronous channels requires either infinite amount of memory or giving up progress… but guess what, many real systems can’t afford neither of those restrictions. Thus, trade-offs need to be made regarding reliability for the system to work, scale smoothly and have sufficiently strong guarantees. System&amp;rsquo;s heterogeneity, with respect to network capabilities and nodes resources, has important consequences and requires proper strategies to avoid a slow node to impact the entire system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zenoh overhead: a story from our community</title><link>/blog/2021-07-05-zenoh-overhead/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021-07-05-zenoh-overhead/</guid><description>&lt;p>Zenoh&amp;rsquo;s webpage states that zenoh has a minimal wire overhead of &lt;strong>5 bytes&lt;/strong>. This is the result of careful considerations in the zenoh design: from using &lt;strong>Variable Length Encoding (VLE)&lt;/strong>, to efficient &lt;strong>mapping of resource keys&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>automatic batching&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are intrigued about this and want to know more, rest assured that you are not alone. In fact, the minimal overhead aspect of zenoh attracted a lot of attention and curiosity in our community that led to some interesting discussions on zenoh&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/cY4nVjUd">Discord Server&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zenoh performance: a stroll in Rust async wonderland</title><link>/blog/2021-07-13-zenoh-performance-async/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021-07-13-zenoh-performance-async/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since its very first public release, zenoh provided impressive and easily accessible performances (see &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://zenoh.io/blog/2020-06-29-zenoh-tidings/">here&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>).
But instead of resting on laurels, the zenoh team has been relentlessly working on further improving them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result of this work, we are happy to announce that zenoh delivers at least twice the performances than before:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>more than &lt;strong>3.5M msg/s&lt;/strong> with 8 bytes payload,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>more than &lt;strong>45 Gb/s&lt;/strong> with 1 Megabyte payload,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a latency as little as &lt;strong>35 µsec&lt;/strong> in backlogged scenarios.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>As a result of this work, we are happy to announce that we successfully deployed and tested Zenoh in &lt;a href="https://www.zephyrproject.org">Zephyr&lt;/a> (reel_board and nucleo-f767zi) and &lt;a href="https://www.arduino.cc">Arduino&lt;/a> (ESP32) compatible boards, with initial results showcasing a quite remarkable performance within the microcontrollers landscape:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Memory footprint of only ~2.8% (nucleo-f767zi), ~9.2% (reel_board), and ~0.9% (ESP32).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deliver more than 5.2k msg/s with a 8 bytes payload in ESP32.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Application-level throughput of ~9.2 Mbps (thus, saturating a 10 Mbps Ethernet link) with nucleo-f767zi.&lt;/li>

In particular, this was successfully exemplified by using a TurtleBot, a well-known, low-cost, personal robot kit with open-source software and hardware.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this blog, we go one step further to show how you can bring Zenoh down to the TurtleBot’s microcontroller and control it from a different geographic location via a Zenoh infrastructure.

With the increases in energy costs and its constrained availability, there is an increasing necessity to optimize data paths and to avoid unnecessary data transmissions – as just for clarity, communications takes the lion share in energy consumption when compared to computation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud centric architectures are energetically greedy and offer poor latency. Decentralization becomes an increasingly pressing necessity. In this blog post we will see why mobility raises complex challenges in decentralized deployments and how zenoh, with its efficient discovery and dynamic routing, can offer seamless session migration and overcome those obstacles.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Performance Evaluation on Rust Asynchronous Frameworks</title><link>/blog/2022-04-14-rust-async-eval/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022-04-14-rust-async-eval/</guid><description>&lt;p>As we previously mentioned in &lt;a href="https://zenoh.io/blog/2021-07-13-zenoh-performance-async/">this blog post&lt;/a>, Zenoh is written in &lt;strong>Rust&lt;/strong> and leverages the &lt;strong>async&lt;/strong> features to achieve high performance and scalability. At the present stage, we rely on the &lt;a href="https://async.rs/">async_std&lt;/a> framework – a decision that we took after a careful performance evaluation of the frameworks available in late 2019. This framework has proven to be quite effective, allowing Zenoh to reach more than &lt;strong>4M&lt;/strong> msg/s with 8 bytes payload and over &lt;strong>45Gb/s&lt;/strong> with 1MiB payload while keeping latency of &lt;strong>~30µsS&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zenoh-Pico: Above and Beyond</title><link>/blog/2022-06-09-zenoh-pico-above-and-beyond/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022-06-09-zenoh-pico-above-and-beyond/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a &lt;a href="https://zenoh.io/blog/2021-10-04-zenoh-pico-guide/">previous blog post&lt;/a>, we introduced Zenoh-Pico, an implementation of Zenoh for microcontrollers and embedded devices, along with a preliminary performance results and its integration on off-the-shelf robots (by bridging both legacy ROS2+DDS and Zenoh systems or by making it a full-fledged Zenoh system).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, we will dive deeper on Zenoh-Pico, show, how Zenoh-Pico is capable of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>exchanging close to &lt;strong>2.5M msg/s&lt;/strong> for small payloads, and over &lt;strong>25 Gbps&lt;/strong> for larger messages,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>achieving end-to-end latency (i.e., one way delay) as small as &lt;strong>45 µsec&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>15 µsec&lt;/strong> for unicast and multicast transports, respectively,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>minimizing the overhead in the wire down to &lt;strong>5 bytes&lt;/strong> per data transmission,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>fitting all its capabilities in less than &lt;strong>50KB&lt;/strong> footprint, which can be quickly reduced to &lt;strong>~15KB&lt;/strong> in tailored compilation setups, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>provides &lt;strong>simple&lt;/strong> to use and yet &lt;strong>powerful APIs&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The remainder of this post will compare Zenoh-Pico against technologies currently used in embedded devices, and more specifically with DDS-XRCE, MQTT, and OPC-UA. We will depart from higher layers analyzing the ergonomics and simplicity of the APIs, we will then look into performances and compare throughput, latency, wire overhead, and flash memory footprint.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>There is Land Besides IP: How to Cross It with Zenoh</title><link>/blog/2022-08-12-zenoh-serial/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022-08-12-zenoh-serial/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since the early 2000s the transition towards All-IP networks had been pushed as a natural evolutionary path.

&lt;p>Until now, Zenoh was only supporting server-based authentication.
That is the kind of authentication you experience when surfing the web using HTTPS: your browser verifies if the server it is connecting to is legit, but the server does not authenticate your browser.
That’s why you need to use the user and password if you want to authenticate to the service itself.
In Zenoh, it was the same until now as shown in the figure below.
As a client or peer you could verify the authenticity of the router by using &lt;a href="https://zenoh.io/docs/manual/tls/">TLS&lt;/a>, but then the router would use &lt;a href="https://zenoh.io/docs/manual/user-password/">user and password authentication&lt;/a> to validate the clients, peers as well as other routers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Blue Dragon meets the Wire’s Shark</title><link>/blog/2023-01-17-zenoh-wireshark/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023-01-17-zenoh-wireshark/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this blog post, we will introduce Zenoh’s best friend, the &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://github.com/ZettaScaleLabs/zenoh-dissector">Zenoh protocol dissector for Wireshark&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.

&lt;h1 id="what-is-wireshark">What is Wireshark?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark&lt;/a> is a &lt;strong>widely-used network protocol analyzer&lt;/strong>, mostly used to sniff which packets are crossing your network. In other words, it &lt;strong>captures packets and represents them in a human-understandable format&lt;/strong>. This capability of understanding what packets are being exchanged in your network is helpful in a multitude of situations, including troubleshooting network problems, examining security issues, verifying network applications, debugging protocol implementations, and even learning about the network protocol internals.
Zenoh, as a pub/sub/query protocol, is the ideal stack for implementing distributed applications in the Cloud to Thing continuum. Thus, &lt;strong>understanding the network&lt;/strong> and what happens at Zenoh-level communications will allow you to &lt;strong>better understand your applications behavior&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Flow programming with Zenoh-Flow</title><link>/blog/2023-02-10-zenoh-flow/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023-02-10-zenoh-flow/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-flow">Zenoh-Flow&lt;/a> was the concluding episode of Zenoh’s webinar series &amp;ldquo;Taming the Dragon&amp;rdquo; released recently and available on ZettaScale’s Youtube channel.

Zenoh gained a lot of traction with very positive feedback from diverse industries, including Robotics, Industrial Automation, Automotive and more. If you haven’t tried it yet and you think it could help you, don’t hesitate, we guarantee it’s easy and worth your time!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog post will focus on another exciting project we are building: Zenoh-Flow. As its name indicates, Zenoh-Flow brings together the control of data flow programming and the power of Zenoh. Think of distributed applications where you don’t have to know the exact location of your computing units, but simply agree on the name (and type) of the resources they are going to exchange, how they are connected and, if needed, the properties of the host(s) on which they are going to run. Add to this list a validation step, uniquely named resources, great performance and you would start to have a good idea of what Zenoh-Flow has to offer!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Streamlining Zenoh router Monitoring with Datadog Integration</title><link>/blog/2024-04-17-datadog-zenoh-router-integration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024-04-17-datadog-zenoh-router-integration/</guid><description>&lt;figure class="figure-inline">&lt;img src="../../img/20240417-Datadog-Zenoh-Router-Integration/1-dashboard.png"

The key features are:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="api">API&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Stabilization of liveliness API support. Liveliness has been part of Zenoh for quite some time but the API was still marked as unstable. We have now stabilized it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New unstable querier API for automatic queries optimization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A new unstable advanced publisher/subscriber on zenoh-ext supporting non-blocking fault tolerance end-to-end.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="zenoh-pico">Zenoh-Pico&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>New unstable manual batching for zenoh-pico for improved throughput.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added liveliness support to align with the other Zenoh APIs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Performance improvement due to some internal code refactoring.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added support for Raspberry Pi Pico board.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="ros-2-bridge">ROS 2 Bridge&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Better support of ROS 2 Iron and Jazzy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A ROS 2 Service Client can more easily call a Zenoh Queryable via the bridge.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="protocol-updates">Protocol Updates&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Backward-compatible fix of protocol fragmentation in case of messages drop. The issue was resulting in some large messages being malformed after defragmentation. This is now fixed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fix serial link to support connection re-establishment. Serial connections struggled to be reestablished upon link failure. This has been improved.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="commercial-support-and-tools">Commercial Support and Tools&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>ZettaScale provides commercial support as well as extended lifetime support for v1.x.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ZettaScale now provides a commercial of Zenoh for QNX.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Zetta Control Center (ZettaC2) is now available to visualise, monitor and manage your running Zenoh System from the cloud to the microcontroller.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="querier">Querier&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The querier has been added to Zenoh to serve a similar purpose of the publisher but for queries. For example, a publisher allows Zenoh to perform some optimization for continuous publications like &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://zenoh.io/blog/2024-10-21-zenoh-firesong/%23interest-protocol&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=docs&amp;amp;ust=1733925165202597&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1piF0-TzhbWXLP5chS1fKO">write-side filtering&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://docs.rs/zenoh/latest/zenoh/pubsub/struct.Publisher.html#method.matching_status">matching status&lt;/a>. These kinds of optimizations are now also available for queries through the new querier API.
